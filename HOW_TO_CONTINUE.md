# How to Continue Work on tradoctor

This document explains how to pause and resume work on the tradoctor project, so you (or any contributor) can pick up right where you left off.

---

## 1. Open `PROJECT_TASKS.md`
- All project tasks are listed in sprint order.
- Each task includes:
  - Title
  - Labels
  - Estimated time
  - Description
  - **Clear acceptance criteria**

## 2. Pick the Next Open Task
- Start with **Task 1** if you're beginning.
- Move the task to **"In Progress"** on the project board.
- When done, check off acceptance criteria and move the ticket to **"Done"**.
- Tasks are atomic and actionable. If you want to work out of order, check for dependencies in the acceptance criteria.

## 3. Reference the Architecture Schematic
- See [`docs/architecture-schematic.md`](docs/architecture-schematic.md) for:
  - System overview
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Agent communication diagrams
  - Component descriptions

## 4. Use the GitHub Project Board
- The board is set up with columns for Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, etc.
- Add issues to the board as needed.
- Move issues through columns as you work.

## 5. Repeat
- Continue picking the next open task, working on it, and moving it through the workflow.
- If you need help, consult the architecture schematic or ask for implementation help.
